# Project Refactoring Summary

## What We Did

### 1. Removed False Information
- ❌ Removed panic about "12 hours" deadline (we have 6 days)
- ❌ Removed emphasis on Boltz API (not the focus)
- ❌ Removed UI endpoints from API planning (backend focus)
- ✅ Updated timeline to August 3, 2025 deadline

### 2. Organized Project Structure

└── README.md                  # Project overview
```

### 3. Created Key Documents
- **Backend Implementation Checklist** - Step-by-step guide for developers
- **Realistic Winning Strategy** - 6-day plan without panic
- **System Architecture** - Clear technical design
- **Project Structure** - Directory organization

### 4. Archived/Removed
- Moved Boltz integration guide to archives
- Removed UI-focused planning documents
- Removed stretch goal API specs
- Cleaned up duplicate files

## Current Status

### ✅ Ready
- Complete API specification
- Clear implementation checklist
- Realistic 6-day timeline
- Organized documentation

### 🎯 Next Steps
1. Initialize Rust project in `bitcoin-htlc/`
2. Follow backend implementation checklist
3. Focus on core functionality first
4. Add stretch goals only if time permits

## Key Decisions

1. **API First** - Backend focus, no UI in API spec
2. **Core Features Only** - No partial fills in main spec
3. **6-Day Timeline** - Realistic planning without rush
4. **Documentation Driven** - Clear guides before coding

## Remember

We have 6 days to build a solid implementation. Focus on:
- Making atomic swaps work correctly
- Clean API implementation
- Reliable demo execution

Don't worry about:
- Having the prettiest UI (can add simple one later)
- Complex features (partial fills, multi-resolver)
- Competing on features we don't need

**Quality over Quantity** - A working atomic swap beats a buggy feature-rich system.
