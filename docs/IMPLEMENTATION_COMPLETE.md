# ðŸŽ‰ Thunder Portal Implementation Complete!

## What I've Built

A complete Rust backend service that implements Bitcoin HTLCs for atomic swaps, fully compliant with your OpenAPI specification.

## Quick Start (3 Commands!)

```bash
cd bitcoin-htlc
./setup.sh
cargo run
```

That's it! Service running at http://localhost:3000

## Alternative: Docker

```bash
cd bitcoin-htlc
docker-compose up
```

## Test It's Working

```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/health

# Create an order
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "direction": "ETH_TO_BTC",
    "bitcoin_amount": 100000,
    "bitcoin_address": "tb1qw508d6qejxtdg4y5r3zarvary0c5xw7kxpjzsx",
    "bitcoin_public_key": "03789ed0bb717d88f7d321a368d905e7430207ebbd82bd342cf11ae157a7ace5fd",
    "preimage_hash": "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
  }'
```

## Key Files Created

1. **`.env.example`** - Complete environment configuration with all variables documented
2. **`README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation with examples
3. **`setup.sh`** - One-click setup script
4. **`Makefile`** - Common commands (make run, make test, make docker-run)
5. **Full Rust implementation** - All API endpoints, HTLC logic, database

## Architecture Highlights

### API Compliance âœ…
- All endpoints from OpenAPI spec implemented
- Proper request/response models
- Input validation
- Error handling

### Bitcoin HTLC âœ…
- Script generation with correct opcodes
- P2SH address creation  
- Transaction building (fund, claim, refund)
- Preimage/hash management

### Production Ready Features âœ…
- SQLite database with migrations
- Docker support
- Comprehensive tests
- Key generation utility
- Logging and monitoring

## Next Steps for Demo

1. **Generate Keys** (if needed)
   ```bash
   cargo run --example generate_keys
   ```

2. **Get Testnet Bitcoin**
   - https://bitcoinfaucet.uo1.net/
   - Send to your address

3. **Create HTLC**
   - Use API to create order
   - Get P2SH address
   - Fund with testnet BTC

4. **Test Atomic Swap**
   - Submit Fusion+ proof
   - Claim with preimage
   - Or wait for timeout and refund

## What Makes This Special

1. **HTLC-as-a-Service** - Abstract complexity from resolvers
2. **Fusion+ Native** - Built specifically for 1inch integration  
3. **Bidirectional** - Both ETHâ†’BTC and BTCâ†’ETH
4. **Secure** - Proper timeouts, validation, no trust required
5. **Testnet Ready** - Full testnet support, no node needed

## Common Commands

```bash
make run        # Start service
make test       # Run tests
make docker-run # Run with Docker
make keys       # Generate keys
make test-api   # Test endpoints
```

The implementation is ready to demonstrate Bitcoin atomic swaps integrated with 1inch Fusion+! ðŸš€
