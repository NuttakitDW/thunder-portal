# API Specification Success Criteria for Thunder Portal

## Overview
This document defines the criteria for a successful cross-chain atomic swap API specification. Use this checklist to evaluate whether the API spec is complete, secure, and ready for implementation.

## ✅ Core Atomic Swap Requirements

### 1. **Bidirectional Swap Support** 
- [x] Supports ETH → BTC swaps (ETH_TO_BTC enum defined)
- [x] Supports BTC → ETH swaps (BTC_TO_ETH enum defined)
- [x] Clear separation of flow logic for each direction
- [x] No assumptions about one direction being primary

### 2. **HTLC Implementation**
- [x] Both chains use HTLCs (stated in API principles)
- [x] HTLC creation endpoints defined (part of order flow)
- [x] HTLC verification endpoints for user-created contracts (`/htlc/verify`)
- [x] HTLC claim mechanism with preimage reveal (`/htlc/{htlcId}/claim`)
- [x] HTLC refund mechanism after timeout (`/htlc/{htlcId}/refund`)

### 3. **Timeout Hierarchy**
- [x] Bitcoin timeout MUST be > 2x Ethereum timeout (line 13 in spec)
- [x] Timeout validation in API (timeouts object in CreateOrderRequest)
- [x] Clear timeout parameters in requests (ethereumBlocks, bitcoinBlocks)
- [x] Timeout enforcement in status transitions (refund returns 409 if not reached)

### 4. **Order of Operations**
- [x] ETH→BTC: Fusion+ proof BEFORE Bitcoin HTLC creation (awaiting_fusion_proof → bitcoin_htlc_created)
- [x] BTC→ETH: Bitcoin HTLC verification BEFORE Fusion+ filling (bitcoin_htlc_verified → fusion_order_filling)
- [x] No race conditions in the flow (strict status progression)
- [x] Clear status progression for each step (14 distinct statuses)

## ✅ Security Requirements

### 5. **Atomic Guarantees**
- [x] Both succeed or both fail (terminal states: completed, refunded, expired, failed)
- [x] No partial execution states (strict status enum)
- [x] Clear rollback mechanisms (refund endpoint + expired status)
- [x] Timeout-based refunds (`/htlc/{htlcId}/refund` with timeout check)

### 6. **Verification Mechanisms**
- [x] Fusion+ order verification (FusionProofRequest with signatures)
- [x] Bitcoin HTLC script verification (VerifyHtlcRequest with 6 checks)
- [x] Payment hash validation (preimageHash field throughout)
- [x] Public key validation (bitcoinPublicKey, resolverPublicKey fields)
- [x] Amount validation (amount fields with string type for precision)

### 7. **Attack Prevention**
- [x] Front-running protection via preimage commitment (preimageHash required)
- [x] Timeout hierarchy prevents griefing (Bitcoin > 2x Ethereum enforced)
- [x] No trust assumptions between parties (stated in principles)
- [x] Clear error states for malicious inputs (409 for invalid refund, structured errors)

## ✅ Integration Requirements

### 8. **1inch Fusion+ Compatibility**
- [x] Accepts Fusion+ order proofs (`/orders/{orderId}/fusion-proof` endpoint)
- [x] Returns Fusion+ order requirements (fusionOrderRequirements in response)
- [x] Resolver address configuration (resolverAddress field)
- [x] EIP-712 signature support (fusionOrderHash, fusionOrderSignature)

### 9. **Bitcoin Network Support**
- [x] P2SH address generation (address field in HTLC responses)
- [x] Script hash validation (redeemScript field)
- [x] Transaction monitoring (`/transactions/{txId}/status`)
- [x] Confirmation tracking (fundingConfirmations in OrderDetails)
- [x] Multiple network support (mainnet/testnet servers defined)

### 10. **Ethereum Token Support**
- [x] Native ETH support (0x0 address notation)
- [x] ERC-20 token support (TokenInfo schema with symbol/address)
- [x] Token address validation (pattern: ^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$)
- [x] Amount conversion handling (fromToken/toToken fields)

## ✅ API Design Requirements

### 11. **RESTful Design**
- [x] Clear resource modeling (orders, HTLCs, transactions as resources)
- [x] Proper HTTP methods (POST for create/submit/claim, GET for status)
- [x] Consistent naming conventions (/resource/{id}/action pattern)
- [x] Proper status codes (201 Created, 409 Conflict, 503 Unavailable)

### 12. **Status Tracking**
- [x] Comprehensive status enum covering all states (14 statuses defined)
- [x] Clear status transitions documented (flow diagrams in OrderStatus)
- [x] No ambiguous states (each status has clear meaning)
- [x] Terminal states clearly defined (completed, refunded, expired, failed)

### 13. **Error Handling**
- [x] Structured error responses (Error schema with code/message/details)
- [x] Clear error codes (e.g., INVALID_AMOUNT)
- [x] Actionable error messages (e.g., "Timeout too short: 100 blocks < required 144")
- [x] Validation error details (details object for additional context)

### 14. **Documentation**
- [x] All endpoints documented (descriptions for every path)
- [x] Request/response examples (example values in schemas)
- [x] Flow diagrams included (in OrderStatus description)
- [x] Common scenarios explained (ETH→BTC and BTC→ETH flows)

## ✅ Operational Requirements

### 15. **Monitoring & Webhooks**
- [x] Status webhook support (`/webhooks` registration endpoint)
- [x] Event notifications for state changes (13 event types defined)
- [x] Transaction monitoring endpoints (`/transactions/{txId}/status`)
- [x] Health check endpoints (`/health` with comprehensive checks)

### 16. **Idempotency & Reliability**
- [x] Idempotent operations where needed (GET endpoints naturally idempotent)
- [x] Clear operation IDs (UUID format for orderId, htlcId)
- [x] Retry-safe endpoints (status checks can be retried safely)
- [x] Consistent state management (one-way status transitions)
